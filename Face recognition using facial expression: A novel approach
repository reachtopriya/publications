Abstract

Facial expressions are undoubtedly the most effective nonverbal communication. The face has always been the equation of a person's identity. 
The face draws the demarcation line between identity and extinction. Each line on the face adds an attribute to the identity. 
These lines become prominent when we experience an emotion and these lines do not change completely with age. 
In this paper we have proposed a new technique for face recognition which focuses on the facial expressions of the subject to identify his face. 
This is a grey area on which not much light has been thrown earlier. According to earlier researches it is difficult to alter the natural expression. 
So our technique will be beneficial for identifying occluded or intentionally disguised faces. 
The test results of the experiments conducted prove that this technique will give a new direction in the field of face recognition.
This technique will provide a strong base to the area of face recognition and will be used as the core method for critical defense security related issues.
